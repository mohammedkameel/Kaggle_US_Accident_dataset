## Kaggle_US_Accident_dataset

This is the main read me file which contains all the information about the countrywide car accident dataset, which covers 49 states of the USA. The accident data are collected from February 2016 to Dec 2021, using multiple APIs that provide streaming traffic incident (or event) data. I have done EDA on the same.
**Currently, there are about 2.8 million accident records in this dataset.**
